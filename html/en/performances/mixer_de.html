Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!</p><p>The performers ask a member of the audience for his/her birthday and then search on Wikipedia for historical events that took place on that day throughout history. The group then plays scenes based on some of those events.</p><p><strong>Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE.

In ‘The Place’ we’ll go to a specific location and take a glimpse into the lives of the people we find there. Who will we meet there at 5 o’clock in the morning on a cloudy Wednesday? What happened there 30 years ago on the last day of spring at the exact same spot? Make sure you get to ‘The Place’ where you can be a voyeur, as the performers explore relationships through time and space in a poetic and dynamic mix, while you sit back and soak up the view.</p><p><strong>Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE.

The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama groups in other Estonian theaters or work as freelancers in various theater, television and film projects.</p><p>In addition to actors, there are also musicians and a lighting designer in the group, who help to create worlds full of fantasy on the stage.</p><p>The Imperials entertain audiences with performances, create excitement at different events and improve the capability to work together in improv workshops.

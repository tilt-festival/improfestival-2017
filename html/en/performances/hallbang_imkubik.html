There is an app, an algorithm that enables any relationship; lust, sex, and love are not bound by money, time or place.</p><p>There are no more random meetings, no chance encounters, yet you can have any Love™ you like. Just a tap and a swipe at the tip of your digits means you need never be alone - once you’ve found your #perfectmatch2k30. Sounds like the perfect dance of two violins in a perfect world.</p><p>But what happens if there’s discordance in the formula? When is perfect not perfect enough? Can you patch the glitch?</p><p>#Perfectmatch2k30 explores the spaces between binary relations and the future of love - in a world where perfection is possible, what would it take for you to upgrade Love™?</p><hr><p>“The secret to humour is surprise.” Aristotle</p><p>Hall and the Bang is a surprising duo.</p><p>They first met in Germany 2014 unlocking a shared passion for pushing and being pushed, while discovering a deep mutual respect.</p><p>An actor from Perth, Australia. An actor from Göteborg, Sweden. Endless days. Never ending nights. Kangaroos. Reindeer. Vegemite. Ikea.</p><p>A long distance collaboration. 13,780 kilometres to be precise.</p><p>For Victoria and Glenn, it’s this surprise that inspires their Playful Chaos. Trepidation mixed with Trust. They push each others’ buttons in a way that surprises not only their audience, but themselves. Their objective is to be present with each other in every moment, refusing to plan ahead and create stories, rather, to notice the stories that have been created. They are actors who feel first and reason why later.</p><p>They dig into the humorous and uncomfortable truth of human relationships.</p><p>The secret isn’t to discover what’s not there, but to notice and surprise each other with what’s there. Like a piece of flat-pack IKEA furniture with no branding or instructions.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.hallbang.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hallbang.com</a></li></ul><h3 id="imkubik-che---without-a-word">imKubik (CHE) - “Without a word”</h3><p><strong>In English</strong></p><p>“With(out) a word” - if we talk, it’s only “gibberish”</p><p>Originating from the association with specific words defined by the audience, three main characters walk on a nonverbal journey of improvised stories. Scene for scene wordless, however strong-voiced and with unconstrained body language, altered worlds emerge and are explored with and by the spectators/viewers. Equipped with vocal sound tools, music and words on paper notes, which are collected from the audience prior to the show, the imKubik Ensemble embarks on telling entire stories without using one single spoken word.</p><hr><p>Towards the end of 2014 by a so called happy ”coincidence” three crazy Improv Actors met on stage as one theatresports-team… it was love at first sight. Immediately after the show, they decided that the time had come, to set into motion what apparently was obvious for many – to form an ensemble. That night manifested the trio “imKubik”.</p><p>Ever since, the three gentleman like to surprise each other live on stage. They truthfully live by their motto: Pure inspiration here and now! No matter how insignificant a moment may appear, with their intuition and their highly inspirational energy, they manage to turn it into a highlight no new TV show can offer.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.imkubik.ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">imkubik.ch</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/imkubikimpro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/imkubikimpro</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>

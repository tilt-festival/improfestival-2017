Different characters dive into captivating twisters of scenic events, not knowing where it will lead them. Humorous points of views, unexpected revelations, and gripping relations will surprise us every step of the way.</p><hr><p>Toivo Värbu and Rauno Meronen are improvisers from Ruutu10. They started their duo show in the spring of 2016. Rauno says: “We did not have much of a vision about how the format should look like. Toivo wants more of a TJ &amp; Dave styled slow comedy, whereas I would like a Middleage Comeback styled sweaty chaos. So we are somewhere in between, sometimes one way, other times another way.“</p><h3 id="moscow-improv-club-rus---1-2-3-poyekhali">Moscow Improv Club (RUS) - “1, 2, 3 Poyekhali!”</h3><p><strong>In English</strong></p><p>Yes, improv in Russia exists!

She is also a lighting technician for Ugala Theatre.</p><p>She has been working in the field for about five years and has grown with Tilt since the first festival in 2013. Improv found Mari-Riin and she found improv, through the main organizer Rahel and soon they started IMPROving the collaboration between actors and technicians.</p><p>Though working in a classical theatre and with improv is in a way similar, there are many factors that play much bigger role in improv show for her as a lighting technician. Mainly, she likes the feeling of “really being on the spot” while doing the shows, because in improv she can play together with the actors and have so much bigger impact on the show!</p><p>In addition to the festival TILT, she has worked in several bigger theatres in Estonia and done many designs for shows (drama, dance, concerts ect.)</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>

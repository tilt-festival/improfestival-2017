LOCATION:Raekoja plats 18
SUMMARY:Talking, no talking
DESCRIPTION:Improv actors love talking. And they love to do it in the same sized portions.We see tons of scenes in which the actors are taking turns talking in a steadyrhythm throughout the whole scene. Even experienced improv actors that naturallyyes-and, consider space and plot, and respect emotion still have a tendency tocling to this pattern of talk.This workshop is aiming to break this routine. The participants are asked totalk less and make use of pauses of speech as well as increase the value oftheir speech when talking. The players get to do monologues or to not talk atall throughout a whole scene. They learn to respect when a dramatic climaxneeds silence, and to be attentive enough to not miss when a turning point isbeing reached. It is about focus, taking turns in new ways and humbleness.We will use simple tools that are simply genius. An eye-opener for shapingyour way of talking on stage.Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisersSeverin Mahncke is a member of frei.wild Improtheater Berlin since 2005 andhas been a member of BIG in Barcelona for two years.

SUMMARY:Hall and the Bang (SWE/AUS) - "#Perfectmatch2K30" & imKubik (CHE) - "Without a word"
DESCRIPTION:            Hall and the Bang (SWE/AUS) - “#Perfectmatch2K30”In EnglishDownloading Love™ is easy. There is an app, an algorithm that enablesany relationship; lust, sex, and love are not bound by money, time or place.There are no more random meetings, no chance encounters, yet you can haveany Love™ you like. Just a tap and a swipe at the tip of your digits meansyou need never be alone - once you’ve found your #perfectmatch2k30.Sounds like the perfect dance of two violins in a perfect world.But what happens if there’s discordance in the formula? When is perfect notperfect enough? Can you patch the glitch?#Perfectmatch2k30 explores the spaces between binary relations and thefuture of love - in a world where perfection is possible, what wouldit take for you to upgrade Love™?“The secret to humour is surprise.” AristotleHall and the Bang is a surprising duo.They first met in Germany 2014 unlocking a shared passion for pushing andbeing pushed, while discovering a deep mutual respect.An actor from Perth, Australia. An actor from Göteborg, Sweden. Endless days.Never ending nights. Kangaroos. Reindeer. Vegemite. Ikea.A long distance collaboration. 13,780 kilometres to be precise.For Victoria and Glenn, it’s this surprise that inspires their Playful Chaos.Trepidation mixed with Trust. They push each others’ buttons in a way thatsurprises not only their audience, but themselves. Their objective is to bepresent with each other in every moment, refusing to plan ahead and createstories, rather, to notice the stories that have been created. They are actorswho feel first and reason why later.They dig into the humorous and uncomfortable truth of human relationships.The secret isn’t to discover what’s not there, but to notice and surpriseeach other with what’s there. Like a piece of flat-pack IKEA furniturewith no branding or instructions.  hallbang.comimKubik (CHE) - “Without a word”In English“With(out) a word” - if we talk, it’s only “gibberish”Originating from the association with specific words defined bythe audience, three main characters walk on a nonverbal journey of improvised stories. Scene for scene wordless, however strong-voicedand with unconstrained body language, altered worlds emerge and areexplored with and by the spectators/viewers. Equipped with vocal soundtools, music and words on paper notes, which are collected from theaudience prior to the show, the imKubik Ensemble embarks on tellingentire stories without using one single spoken word.Towards the end of 2014 by a so called happy ”coincidence”three crazy Improv Actors met on stage as one theatresports-team…it was love at first sight. Immediately after the show, they decidedthat the time had come, to set into motion what apparently was obviousfor many – to form an ensemble. That night manifested the trio “imKubik”.Ever since, the three gentleman like to surprise each other live on stage.They truthfully live by their motto: Pure inspiration here and now! No matterhow insignificant a moment may appear, with their intuition and their highlyinspirational energy, they manage to turn it into a highlight no new TVshow can offer.  imkubik.ch  facebook.com/imkubikimpro

SUMMARY:Peak Performance
DESCRIPTION:Can we perform at our best more often? Why does everyone warm-up differently,and is there a common ground for how best to prepare for a performance?Can I prevent myself going ‘into my head’, whilst I am in the wings mid-show,or out-of-focus mid-scene?Beginning from the basis of impulse technique and mindfulness, Nick Byrnefirst created a course called “In The Moment” to discover exercises allowingimprovisers to genuinely feel what it is like to be in this mindset; enablingthem to recall that feeling and re-visit it more often. After working withOlympic athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport, to help them retaina state of readiness, whatever might happen before or during their events,Nick re-applied his discoveries back to the theatre.The result is a collection of techniques that will liberate you from worriesthat are less than useful, take you out of your head and into the moment,allow you to keep whatever warm-up activity you like, and give you a moreconsistent, satisfying, and enjoyable performance.Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.Artistic Director of the widely celebrated Australian unscripted theatre festival,Improvention, Nick is most well known for creating new show formats that have beenperformed across the world, and for developing new techniques for improvisers toovercome fears about themselves or certain styles of performance they thoughtthey weren’t capable of.Originally, a professional musician, then a scripted theatre performer/director,Nick brings wide experience to his passionate obsession for improvisation, whichhe teaches and performs several most days/nights in his hometown of Canberra.He has also done so in Goteborg, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam, Liverpool, Singapore,Tokyo, and throughout Australia.Nick shamelessly takes a wholistic approach to improvisation, considering it amindset to incorporate in life, as on stage, and is as interested in helpingimprovisers to become comfortable enough in any situation, to perform at their best,as he is to explore new performance concepts and skillsets.He loves life and people.

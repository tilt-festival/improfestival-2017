To Flavien, Improv is a page, already written in invisible ink that you only have to read. Improv is not a creative effort, it’s an ability of the artist to be present and open enough to be the receptacle as well as the medium of Art.</p><p>In this class Flavien Reppert will give you Improv glasses to see everything. You’ll read the scenes, the space, the objects and of course your partners. Everything is already there, there’s nothing to be created or invented. There’s just momentum to be revealed.</p><p>Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisers</p><p>Skills and Tools: Reading scenes/ slow improv / support</p><hr><p>Flavien has been improvising and acting since 1996. He graduated in drama at the Conservatoire and in Theatre at the University of Strasbourg and started his professional career in 2004. He has been teaching improv/drama since 2001. Flavien is the Artistic Director and founder of the professional Company: Le Théâtre de l’Oignon. He is also a happy member of Ohana: The European Improvisers Project.</p><p>Flavien has a global approach to improv: a joyful combination of many schools of thoughts. His teaching is multicultural and multi influenced, he tries to give the best taste of every improv style he has met. His goal is to build bridges between people, cultures, languages and improv styles.</p><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.com/Flaviencomedien" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/Flaviencomedien</a></li><li><a href="https://www.flavien-reppert.book.fr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">flavien-reppert.book.fr</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/theatredeloignon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/theatredeloignon</a></li><li><a href="http://www.loignon.eu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">loignon.eu</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>

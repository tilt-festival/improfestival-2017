Your body is much more smarter than your brains and it's an open
book worth to be read. Let's leave our brains backstage and follow
our animal instincts. Listen to our bodies and our senses.

- The Tiger (Fire): Release the Power
- The Shark (Water): the 6th Sense
- The Dragon (Air) : The Magic

Perfect for: beginning and intermediate improvisers

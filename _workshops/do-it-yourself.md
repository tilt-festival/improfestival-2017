*"You gotta prepare a great party, before you invite your friends!"*<br><br>

First step when you improvise is to build up the courage and jump on an empty stage. You got that and it feels good. 
Many improvisers at that moment though, feel the need to have someone with them on stage. It's the fear of not being able to handle that scary big-ol' stage all by themselves. They anxiously wait for someone, they call for mom, they pick up the phone and make a call... Welcoming someone else on stage is one thing. Desperately needing them is another.
This workshop will show you how to take care of yourself on stage when you're all by yourself. It'll help you enjoy every single moment and find inspiration from the nothing, regardless of another player joins you or not.<br><br>

Perfect for: beginning and intermediate improvisers and goats. Goats have a lot to teach us.

After having lived in Austin, Texas for a number of years, Menelaos moved back to Greece where he founded ImproVIBE, Greece's first and only Improv training center. It has been running for 4 years now and he takes students there through their complete training, from baby steps all the way to them producing a full-blown narrative.<br>
He travels often outside of Athens to teach subject specific workshops, and/or corporate workshops and has taught some of his workshops in Belgium and Turkey.<br>
The stage elements Menelaos mostly focuses on are not relying on words, being able to handle the stage all by yourself, and finding inspiration that truly pleases you at all cost.<br>
Menelaos has also been performing on a weekly basis with Bus Kai, his two-person troupe for the past 3 years non-stop (also internationally), and with a 6-member team for the past year. He has also taken clowning workshops and method acting.<br>

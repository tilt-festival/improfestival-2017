Improv actors love talking. And they love to do it in the same sized portions.
We see tons of scenes in which the actors are taking turns talking in a steady
rhythm throughout the whole scene. Even experienced improv actors that naturally
yes-and, consider space and plot, and respect emotion still have a tendency to
cling to this pattern of talk.

This workshop is aiming to break this routine. The participants are asked to
talk less and make use of pauses of speech as well as increase the value of
their speech when talking. The players get to do monologues or to not talk at
all throughout a whole scene. They learn to respect when a dramatic climax
needs silence, and to be attentive enough to not miss when a turning point is
being reached. It is about focus, taking turns in new ways and humbleness.

We will use simple tools that are simply genius. An eye-opener for shaping
your way of talking on stage.

Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisers

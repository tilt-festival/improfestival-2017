Based on Gianni Rodari's "Grammatica della fantasia" chapter where he explains
how to create characters based on different elements. In this class we will
work the infinite possibilities and combinations of elements, objects, animals,
sensations and feelings to achieve stronger and deeper characters.

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.

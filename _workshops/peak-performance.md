Can we perform at our best more often? Why does everyone warm-up differently,
and is there a common ground for how best to prepare for a performance?
Can I prevent myself going ‘into my head’, whilst I am in the wings mid-show,
or out-of-focus mid-scene? 
 
Beginning from the basis of impulse technique and mindfulness, Nick Byrne
first created a course called “In The Moment” to discover exercises allowing
improvisers to genuinely feel what it is like to be in this mindset; enabling
them to recall that feeling and re-visit it more often. After working with
Olympic athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport, to help them retain
a state of readiness, whatever might happen before or during their events,
Nick re-applied his discoveries back to the theatre.

The result is a collection of techniques that will liberate you from worries
that are less than useful, take you out of your head and into the moment,
allow you to keep whatever warm-up activity you like, and give you a more
consistent, satisfying, and enjoyable performance.

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.

------

Artistic Director of the widely celebrated Australian unscripted theatre festival,
Improvention, Nick is most well known for creating new show formats that have been
performed across the world, and for developing new techniques for improvisers to
overcome fears about themselves or certain styles of performance they thought
they weren't capable of.

Originally, a professional musician, then a scripted theatre performer/director,
Nick brings wide experience to his passionate obsession for improvisation, which
he teaches and performs several most days/nights in his hometown of Canberra.
He has also done so in Goteborg, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam, Liverpool, Singapore,
Tokyo, and throughout Australia.

Nick shamelessly takes a wholistic approach to improvisation, considering it a
mindset to incorporate in life, as on stage, and is as interested in helping
improvisers to become comfortable enough in any situation, to perform at their best,
as he is to explore new performance concepts and skillsets.

He loves life and people.
